Entire industries are being transformed by AI technology, much of which is driven by the recent meteoric advances in generative AI: the variety of AI that produces full content, such as documents, images, speech, and video. These advances have enabled many people to do things they previously were incapable of - such as essay writing or adding special effects to home movies - but have also brought about a series of ethical questions around their development and use - such as the role of AI in Hollywood brought into the public eye through the 2023 writer's strike. These developments raise fundamental questions around whether it is even possible to develop generative AI technology that empowers rather than replaces people, and which serves human values such as rights, justice, and dignity. It also raises the question: Is generative AI different from other technologies that can be used toward both positive and negative ends?

The field of science communication ventures that the answer is not simply a matter of improving capacity (e.g., because people lack scientific information, scientists lack communication skills, or both). Rather, it calls for sustained collaboration and empathy between laypersons and experts. In this hands-on, experiential course, we use a model of cultural competency to put forth solutions to bridge the expert-lay divide. We investigate typical venues in which science is communicated (museums, YouTube videos, federal agency websites, and much much more) and study best practices for communication. Then we explore emerging venues that support sustained contact between so-called ""lay citizens"" and scientific or technical experts (dance/improv techniques, ethnographic methods and citizen science).
