These advances have enabled many people to do things they previously were incapable of - such as essay writing or adding special effects to home movies - but have also brought about a series of ethical questions around their development and use - such as the role of AI in Hollywood brought into the public eye through the 2023 writer's strike. These developments raise fundamental questions around whether it is even possible to develop generative AI technology that empowers rather than replaces people, and which serves human values such as rights, justice, and dignity. It also raises the question: Is generative AI different from other technologies that can be used toward both positive and negative ends?
